# OpenAI HTTP API Playground

The files here can be used with (for example) IntelliJ's
[HTTP API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html)
plugin to conveniently explore and store the OpenAI
HTTP API surface area

Private keys and other secrets referenced in the HTTP API
requests are stored in the `http-client.private.env.json`
file and are managed by the plugin.  This file should not
be checked into this repo.
