- Logged in by supplying any credentials - it accepted them!

## Status
As of Dec 1 2024 paused this - it looks fascinating & promising;
however, my priority now is just to get a simple RAG solution
and I want to get more familiar with the building blocks, so
havd turned to getting more familiar with the Ollama installations.

See the "Ollama" folders here.
