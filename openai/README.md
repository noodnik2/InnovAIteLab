# OpenAI API

This folder stores some experimentation with the OpenAI APIs and their derivatives.

## Configuration

API key(s) may be needed to authorize call(s) to various APIs.  

Copy the template file `.env.template` into `.env` and add the key value(s) there
for retrieval by the code modules using the `bin/envrun` command.

Take caution to protect the secret(s) in `.env`.
